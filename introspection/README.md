# Introspection
### Why you must choose me?
That's a simple yet difficult question at the same time. I would argue that I take risks(digital ones), that's how I learned most things. I learned so much 
tampering with an old laptop in my house. Distro hopping and theming linux distros was my hobby at a time. I have no more arguments, as I will let ya'll decide if I'm a good candidate.

### What is my plan for next 6 months?
Getting a girlfriend was my first priority before coming here, but I've reprioritised, after getting exposed to the vast world of computer science.
As CS domain is big, I think I will explore the breadth by exposing myself to all the domains in CS, before going deep on some specific domains.
Basically, the point is, I want to do explore the world of CS and possibly find something that I may truly love.

### How would I contribute back to the club? 
I will stay consistent, I promise.

### Do I have any feedback on the selection process?
No time to give feedbacks as it is 11.58 pm 14th december
