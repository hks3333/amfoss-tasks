If I have to choose the task that I enjoyed the most, its this one. Questions were amazing, and the feeling after getting the answer right is addictive.
Some questions were like breeze, while some others made me stay up late at night. Some challenges like the deadshot problem felt complicated at first but after 5 minutes of reading, it felt like nothing.
